            <span style="font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;">About Me</span> 
            <p><span style="font-size: larger;"> 
                My name is Steve Rosa and I am currently the Sales Operations Manager in the Atlanta region. 
                I have been with the company for 9 years, starting with the Ford Credit Leadership Development Program in the Nashville Business Center! 
                I have had the opportunity to work in Customer Service, Originations, Dealer Credit, and also as a Team Leader. 
                My various roles have provided a strong background in understanding our business operations. 
                I continue to look for ways to improve on our existing procedures and processes. 
                For example, I created the "Yield Management Tool" for the Atlanta sales team to track portfolio ROE and proactively mitigate risks.
        
                I graduated from Clemson University earning a B.S. in Financial Management, with an emphasis on portfolio management. 
                In my free time I enjoy researching for investing and spending time with family. 
                Family bonding time usually revolves around the kitchen, whether that is cooking for 20+ or whipping up a snack for one, food is a love language we all speak. 
                I take the same analytical approach to perfecting a macaroon as I do investing, creating a delicious masterpiece for others to enjoy is fulfilling.
                I also enjoy mentally stimulating activities and find it very rewarding to learn new skills that take me out of my comfort zone. 
                I am competent in my ability to dissect and understand complex subjects.  
                I believe pursuing a new skillset is an exciting opportunity and I have the mental toughness and positive attitude to persevere and remain optimistic.   
                I also have the humility to ask for help and seek guidance when needed.

            <p><span style="font-size: larger;">
                I want to pursue becoming a software engineer because I understand the endless possibilities there are to create new and exciting products. 
                I see it as a vehicle for the future and the future for our vehicles. 
                I have enjoyed the process of problem solving and building tools in my current role and look to apply these skills to software engineering. 
                As a perpetual learner, the "Learn to Code" program is a unique opportunity to build a new set of skills while continuing to learn and develop within the company. 
                I believe my knowledge and background of sales and finance with additional skills in programming will lead to innovative changes for Ford Credit.
