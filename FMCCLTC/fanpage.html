            <p><span style="font-size: larger;"> 
                My name is Steve Rosa and I am currently the Sales Operations Manager in the Atlanta region. 
                I have been with the company for 9 years, starting with the Ford Credit Leadership Development Program in the Nashville Business Center! 
                I have the humility to ask for help and seek guidance when needed.

            <p><span style="font-size: larger;">
                I want to pursue becoming a software engineer because I understand the endless possibilities there are to create new and exciting products. 
                I see it as a vehicle for the future and the future for our vehicles. 
                I have enjoyed the process of problem solving and building tools in my current role and look to apply these skills to software engineering. 
                As a perpetual learner, the "Learn to Code" program is a unique opportunity to build a new set of skills while continuing to learn and develop within the company. 
                I believe my knowledge and background of sales and finance with additional skills in programming will lead to innovative changes for Ford Credit.
